    about: "I created ScreenWise with one goal in mind, which is to reduce phone usage! The reason is that sometimes I am on my phone too much, and the trackers are only sometimes 100% right. With ScreenWise, you can input the number of hours you have used your phone, add your friends, and even compete with your friends on a leaderboard! However, having the highest screen time is not a flex for this leaderboard; if you see your friend at the top, give them a little nudge and tell them to get off their phone :)",

    about: "WildWoodWatch is an advocacy website that informs people about wildlife and deforestation. It was one of the first projects I ever made, and it was in HTML, CSS, and Javascript! I learned a lot of valuable skills while creating this project, like using Figma for the first time, the importance of responsive design, and the basics of Javascript, which I built upon even today. It is a project worth checking out to see how far I have come in my coding journey!",
